milestone 1 = plan of attack

milestone 2 = create app layout and design basics. Add a list and details view. start adding spinners and other basic 
user interface items. start figuring out what vehicle makes/models i will support and how much information i will provide
per vehicle. 

milestone 3 = start getting most ui items in place. include orientation awareness and have subtle differences in the 
design/layout of the app between orientations. incorporate support on multiple devices(tablet,phone). have details and info
ready to be inserted into the ui for next milestone. 

milestone4 = have all vehicle in database format ready to be integrated and accessed by the application. have final
touches finished up on the ui and all improvements made. have all ui components tested and fully functional. make
sure all comments are in proper places, intact and are meaningful. test activities, test on both device formats
and on both orientation formats on said devices. ensure all code is together and working.
